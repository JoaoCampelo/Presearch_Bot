# Presearch_Bot
Simple bot to automate Presearch searches and get cryptocurrencies daily.

## Notes
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How Use
After installing the project's dependencies, the first thing to do is put your email and password for your Presearch account in the accounts.txt file.
Then run the Presearch_Bot.py file using the following command:

```
python Presearch_Bot.py
```

The first time you run the bot you will have to log in to your account, the only thing you will have to do is the challenge to prove that you are not a robot.

After completing the challenge, you have to go to the command line and press Enter, for the bot to continue the process.

Then the bot does the rest by itself. 
The next times when you run the bot it already logs in by itself using cookies.
